### DynamoDB Stocks Project

This project makes an API call using the [alphavantago.co](https://www.alphavantage.co/) API, then pushes the cleaned data to a local installation of DynamoDB using AWS Lambda functions. Installation instructions for DynamoDB locally can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.DownloadingAndRunning.html).

This repo will contain useful commands and resource creation for future reference, and each Lambda function will receive its own repo. Links to each repo will be added here when they are ready.
